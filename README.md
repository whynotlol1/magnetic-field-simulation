oversimplified simulation of magnetic field lines for 2 magnets (in the future i'll work a bit more on that project)


**changelog**:

05.02.23:
- added the simpliest gravitation simulation (activate with [Q], disabled by default)

**controls**
- moving 1st magnet: [W,A,S,D]
- moving 2nd magnet: [up, left, down, right] (arrows)
- increasing 1st magnet strength: [1]
- decreasing 1st magnet strength: [2]
- increasing 2nd magnet strength: [3]
- decreasing 2nd magnet strength: [4]
- starting the gravitation simulation: [Q]
